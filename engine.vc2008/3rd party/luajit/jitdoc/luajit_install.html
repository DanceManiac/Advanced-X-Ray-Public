LuaJIT is not much more difficult to install than Lua itself.
Just unpack the distribution file, change into the newly created
directory and follow the instructions below.
</p>
<p class="indent">
For the impatient: <b><tt>make&nbsp;linux&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;sudo&nbsp;make&nbsp;install</tt></b><br>
Replace <tt>linux</tt> with e.g. <tt>bsd</tt> or <tt>macosx</tt> depending on your OS.
</p>
<p>
In case you've missed this in <a href="luajit_features.html">Features</a>:
LuaJIT only works on x86 (i386+) systems right now. Support for
other architectures may be added in future versions.
</p>

<h2>Configuring LuaJIT</h2>
<p>
LuaJIT is (deliberately) <em>not</em> autoconfigured &mdash; the
defaults should work fine on most systems. But please check the
system-specific instructions below.
</p>
<p>
The following three files hold all configuration information:
</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>Makefile</tt> holds settings for installing LuaJIT.</li>
<li><tt>src/Makefile</tt> holds settings for compiling LuaJIT.</li>
<li><tt>src/luaconf.h</tt> sets a multitude of configuration
variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If this is your first build then it's better not to give into
the temptation to tweak every little setting. The standard
configuration provides sensible defaults (IMHO).
</p>
<p>
One particular setting you might want to change is the installation
path. Note that you need to modify both the top-level <tt>Makefile</tt>
and <tt>src/luaconf.h</tt> (right at the start) to take
effect.
</p>
<p>
If you have trouble getting Coco to work, you can disable it by
uncommenting the <tt>COCOFLAGS= -DCOCO_DISABLE</tt> line in
<tt>src/Makefile</tt>. But note that this effectively disables
yielding from coroutines for JIT compiled functions.
</p>
<p>
A few more settings need to be changed if you want to
<a href="luajit_debug.html">Debug LuaJIT</a> <em>itself</em>.
Application debugging can be turned on/off at runtime.
</p>

<h3>Upgrading From Previous Versions</h3>
<p>
It's important to keep the LuaJIT core and the add-on modules in sync.
Be sure to delete any old versions of LuaJIT modules from the
Lua module search path (check the current directory, too!).
</p>
<p>
Lua files compiled to bytecode may be incompatible if the underlying
Lua core has changed (like from Lua&nbsp;5.1 alpha to Lua&nbsp;5.1
final between LuaJIT&nbsp;1.0.3 and LuaJIT&nbsp;1.1.0). The same
applies to any
<a href="http://lua-users.org/wiki/BuildingModules"><span class="ext">&raquo;</span>&nbsp;loadable C modules</a>
(shared libraries, DLLs) which need to be recompiled with the new
Lua header files.
</p>
<p>
Compiled bytecode and loadable C modules are fully compatible and
can be freely exchanged between LuaJIT and the <em>same</em>
version of Lua it is based on. Please verify that <tt>LUA_RELEASE</tt>
in <tt>src/lua.h</tt> is the same in both distributions.
</p>

<h2>Building LuaJIT</h2>

<h3>Makefile Targets</h3>
<p>
The Makefiles have a number of targets for various operating systems:
</p>

<div class="tablewrap">
<table class="build">
<tr class="buildhead"><td class="buildsys">System</td><td class="buildcmd">Build Command</td><td>Notes</td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td class="buildsys">Linux i386</td><td class="buildcmd">make linux</td><td></td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td class="buildsys">BSD i386</td><td class="buildcmd">make bsd</td><td>FreeBSD, NetBSD or OpenBSD</td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td class="buildsys">Mac OS X on Intel</td><td class="buildcmd">make macosx</td><td>Check <tt>src/Makefile</tt> for OS X &lt; 10.4</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td class="buildsys">Solaris x86</td><td class="buildcmd">make solaris</td><td>GCC only, SunCC miscompiles LuaJIT</td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td class="buildsys">MinGW (Win32)</td><td class="buildcmd">make mingw</td><td>cross-MinGW: must be 1st in PATH</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td class="buildsys">Cygwin</td><td class="buildcmd">make cygwin</td><td></td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td class="buildsys">POSIX on x86</td><td class="buildcmd">make posix</td><td>Check <a href="coco_portability.html">Portability Req. for Coco</a>, too</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td class="buildsys">Generic x86</td><td class="buildcmd">make generic</td><td>Check <a href="coco_portability.html">Portability Req. for Coco</a>, too</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
You may want to enable interactive line editing for the stand-alone
executable. There are extra targets for Linux, BSD and Mac OS X:
<tt>make&nbsp;linux_rl</tt>, <tt>make&nbsp;bsd_rl</tt>
and <tt>make&nbsp;macosx_rl</tt>.
</p>

<h3>MSVC (Win32)</h3>
<p>
First check out <tt>etc\luavs.bat</tt> if it suits your needs. Then try
running it from the MSVC command prompt (start it from the toplevel directory).
</p>
<p>
Another option is to set up your own MSVC project:
</p>
<p>
Change to the <tt>src</tt> directory
and create a new DLL project for <tt>lua51.dll</tt>.
Add all C files to it except for <tt>lua.c</tt>, <tt>luac.c</tt>
and <tt>print.c</tt>. Add the <tt>..\dynasm</tt> directory
to the include path and build the DLL.
</p>
<p>
Next create a new EXE project for <tt>luajit.exe</tt>.
Add <tt>lua.c</tt> to it and link with the import library
<tt>lua51.lib</tt> created for <tt>lua51.dll</tt>. Build
the executable.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>POSIX systems</h3>
<p>
Run <tt>make&nbsp;install</tt> from the top-level directory.
You probably need to be the root user before doing so, i.e. use
<tt>sudo&nbsp;make&nbsp;install</tt> or <tt>su&nbsp;-&nbsp;root</tt>
before the <tt>make&nbsp;install</tt>.
</p>
<p>
By default this installs only:<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/local/bin/<strong>luajit</strong></tt> &mdash; The stand-alone executable.<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1</tt> &mdash; C module directory.<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/local/share/lua/5.1</tt> &mdash; Lua module directory.<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/local/share/lua/5.1/<strong>jit/*.lua</strong></tt> &mdash;
<tt>jit.*</tt> modules.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Lua docs and includes are not installed to avoid overwriting
an existing Lua installation. In any case these are identical
to the version of Lua that LuaJIT is based on. If you want
to install them, edit the top-level makefile (look for <tt>###</tt>).
</p>
<p>
The stand-alone Lua bytecode compiler <tt>luac</tt> is neither
built nor installed, for the same reason. If you really need it,
you may be better off with <tt>luac</tt> built from the original Lua
distribution (use the <em>same</em> version your copy of LuaJIT
is based on). This avoids dragging in most of LuaJIT which is not
needed for the pure bytecode compiler. You can also use the bare-bones
Lua to bytecode translator <tt>luac.lua</tt> (look in the <tt>test</tt>
directory of the original Lua distribution).
</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>
Copy <tt>luajit.exe</tt> and <tt>lua51.dll</tt>
to a newly created directory (any location is ok). Add <tt>lua</tt>
and <tt>lua\jit</tt> directories below it and copy all Lua files
from the <tt>jit</tt> directory of the distribution to the latter directory.
</p>
<p>
There are no hardcoded
absolute path names &mdash; all modules are loaded relative to the
directory where <tt>luajit.exe</tt> is installed
(see <tt>src/luaconf.h</tt>).
</p>

<h2 id="embedding">Embedding LuaJIT</h2>
<p>
It's strongly recommended that you build the stand-alone executable
with your toolchain and verify that it works <em>before</em> starting
to embed LuaJIT into an application. The stand-alone executable is
also useful later on, when you want to experiment with code snippets
or try out some Lua files.
</p>
<p>
Please consult the Lua docs for general information about how to
embed Lua into your application. The following list only shows
the additional steps needed for embedding LuaJIT:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to add the LuaJIT library functions by running
<tt>luaopen_jit()</tt> after all the other standard library functions.
The modified <tt>src/linit.c</tt> used by the stand-alone executable
already does this for you.</li>
<li><em>Caveat:</em> LuaJIT is based on Lua 5.1 which
means the <tt>luaopen_*()</tt> functions <em>must not</em>
be called directly. See <tt>src/linit.c</tt> for the proper way to
run them. You'll get an error initializing the <tt>io</tt> library
if you don't follow these instructions.</li>
<li>To use the optimizer (strongly recommended) you need to:
<ul>
<li>Install the optimizer modules <tt>jit.opt</tt> and
<tt>jit.opt_inline</tt> relative to the Lua module path
(you've probably modified it &mdash; see <tt>src/luaconf.h</tt>):<br>
<tt>jit/opt.lua</tt><br>
<tt>jit/opt_inline.lua</tt></li>
<li>If you want to ship a single executable then you may want to
embed the optimizer modules into your application (but don't loose
time with this during the early development phase). This involves:
<ul>
<li>Compile the two modules to bytecode
(using <tt>luac&nbsp;-s</tt> from a plain Lua installation).</li>
<li>Convert them to C include files (search for "Lua&nbsp;bin2c").</li>
<li>On Windows you can also put the compiled bytecode into a resource
(search for "Lua&nbsp;bin2res").</li>
<li>Load the bytecode with <tt>luaL_loadbuffer</tt> (but don't run it).</li>
<li>Put the resulting functions into <tt>package.preload["jit.opt"]</tt>
and <tt>package.preload["jit.opt_inline"]</tt>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Activate the LuaJIT optimizer from Lua code to be run at startup:
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;require("jit.opt").start()</tt><br>
Or use equivalent C code. See <tt>dojitopt()</tt> in <tt>src/lua.c</tt>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All other LuaJIT specific modules (<tt>jit.*</tt>) are for debugging only.
They do not need to be shipped with an application. But they may be quite
useful, anyway (especially <tt>jit.trace</tt>).</li>
<li>DynASM is only needed while <em>building</em> LuaJIT. It's not
needed while running LuaJIT and there is no point in shipping or
installing it together with an application.</li>
<li>In case you want to strip some of the standard libraries from
your application: The optimizer modules need several functions from
the base library and the string library (and of course the LuaJIT
core libraries). The io library is only used to print a fatal error
message (you may want to replace it). The optional modules
for debugging depend on a few more library functions &mdash;
please check the source.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although the very liberal LuaJIT
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"><span class="ext">&raquo;</span>&nbsp;license</a>
does not require any acknowledgment whatsoever, it would be appreciated
if you give some credit in the docs (or the "About" box) of your application.
A simple line like:<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;This product includes LuaJIT, http://luajit.org/</tt><br>
would be nice. Please do not include any E-Mail addresses. Thank you!
</p>
<p>
I'm always interested where LuaJIT can be put to good use in applications.
Please <a href="contact.html">tell me</a>
or better yet write a few lines about your project to the
<a href="http://www.lua.org/lua-l.html"><span class="ext">&raquo;</span>&nbsp;Lua mailing list</a>.
Thank you!
