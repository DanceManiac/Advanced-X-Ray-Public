// The ellipse in general form is  X^t A X + B^t X + C = 0 where A is a
// positive definite 2x2 matrix, B is a 2x1 vector, C is a scalar, and X is
// a 2x1 vector X.  Completing the square, (X-U)^t A (X-U) = U^t A U - C
// where U = -0.5 A^{-1} B.  Define M = A/(U^t A U - C).  The ellipse is
// (X-U)^t M (X-U) = 1.  Factor M = R^t D R where R is orthonormal and D is
// diagonal with positive diagonal terms.  The ellipse in factored form is
// (X-U)^t R^t D^t R (X-U) = 1.
//
// Find the least squares fit of a set of N points P[0] through P[N-1].
// Return value is the least-squares energy function at (U,R,D).
