Before  you  implement  your  own shaped form, please take a look at the code of
this  demo.  Several properties are adjusted every time the shape of the form is
changed.

Also  remember  to hide the form before changing it's shape to avoid flicker and
other side effects.

Images are stored in TImage controls, which have width and height set to 0.
