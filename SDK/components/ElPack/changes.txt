ElShutdownWatcher  unit  added.  It's a rarely known fact, that when OS is being
shut  down,  your  application is likely to not perform properly. If you perform
any  actions  AFTER  OnCloseQuery  of  the form is being called (for example, in
OnDestroy or OnClose of the form), you have all chances to lose your data. Why -
because  most  of  API  functions  will fail with error code "system is shutting
down".  To  solve  this  problem (in 99% of cases. The solution doesn't work for
actions  taken  in  Finalization  of  the  units) just include this unit to your
project.

forms.  If you have controls, that are put to the side bar sections, you need to
migrate to new version as follows:

1) For every section that contains controls, select all controls on the section,
copy them to Clipboard and then paste to some text file.
2) Delete all controls from the section panels. 
3) Set ContainsControls property for these sections to false.
4) Save the forms.

7)  Copy the controls from the text files (to which you have copied them before)
and paste them to section panels.

need to keep the files from the old version, and install current version over
the old files.

TBaseComponent renamed to TElBaseComponent to avoid name conflicts.

image when it is saved to the stream 3 to 4 times smaller.

ElPanel:

+  Grab  Handles  added. They offer the customer a new way to move or resize the
panel  in  run-time.  Grab Handle can also be used to move Panel's Parent!!! The
latter  feature is especially useful when you put the panel to the ElAppBar with
Align=alClient, and need to move the AppBar, which has no caption or borders.

ElScrollBar  component  added.  ElScrollBar  is  a  complete VCL replacement for
Windows  scrollbar,  that  offers  additional  buttons, owner-draw support, flat
buttons and thumb, scroll-hint and more ...

All components, that support flat borders, got new option: now it is possible to

packages   are   ElPackXY.dpk   and   ElpkdbXY.dpk.   Design-time  packages  are
dceldbXY.dpk    and    dclelpXX.dpk.    X    stands    for    Borland    product

properties.
!  The  button  now draws the focus rectangle around the whole button internals,
including both text and glyphs.
* The text and glyph location is calculated correctly when using arrow. 


ElFormPersist:

* The change in VCL 4+ (Delphi4, Delphi 5, C++Builder 4) caused the problem with
storing the components' properties. Fixed.


ElTree:

+  Now you get much more flexibility in customizing ElTree in Design-time. I.e.
   ElTree   header   behaves  exactly  like in run-time. You can visually resize
   header sections, scroll the tree etc.

right  border  of  some  section  behind  the  header itself, thus assiging some
sections negative width. Now this is fixed.


ElGauge: 

* CriticalValue and CriticalColor are now taken into account

ElFlatController, ElHook:

*  The unexpected AVs that appeared when there were many components on the form,
fixed.


================================ Version 2.40  =================================

New components:

+ ElFlatController - allows to turn almost any control into flat control.
+  ElFlatMultiController  -  when  dropped  on the form, turns all controls into
  flat.  Then  you  can  define, which controls will remain flat, and which ones
  should have an old-style border.
+ ElFlatComboBox,  ElFlatListBox, ElFlatEdit, ElFlatMemo - just the enhancements
  of standard VCL controls, that implement "Flat" look.
+  ElButtonEdit  -  the generic control which is useful when you need to let the
  user   enter   some  text or press one of two buttons (for example, one button
  will  invoke   a  file  selection dialog, while the second one will invoke the
  previous selections list).
+  ElCheckBox   and  ElRadioButton  - These VCL replacements of Windows controls
  allow   you   to   have  transparent  and  colored checkboxes and radiobuttons
  with SoundMap and flat style support.

ElOneInstance: 

+  NoAutoTerminate  property  added.  If  there  is  no OnExist handler and this
property  is  set,  the second instance doesn't switch to the first instance and
just  allows  your application to obtain the handles of the application, window,
main window and the process handle of the previous instance.


ElTree:

+ AutoResizeColumns  property  added.  When this property is set to true, ElTree
  will   respond  to  double-click  on header section resize area, adjusting the
  width of  the  column.  When  the  property  is false, OnHeaderSectionAutoSize
  event is fired.

  rectangle is drawn when the tree is not focused.
! HideSelection behavior changed. When HideSelection is set, and the tree is not
  focused, selected items are drawn with clBtnFace brush color.

ElHeader:

  added.  These  properties  allow  you  to  draw  an  arrow  similar to Excel's
  autofilter  button.   OnFilterCell   event   is   fired,   when   the arrow is
  clicked. Filter and Lookup are mutually exclusive.
+  FilterColor  and  ActiveFilterColor properties added. These properies control
  the color of the filter arrow.
+  OnFilterCall event added. It is fired when the user presses the filter arrow.
+  OnSectionAutoSize  event  added.  It is fired when the user double-clicks the
  resize area. See ElTree's comments on AutoResizeColumns property.

ElIniFile:

! Default (unnamed) values for the keys vere written to Registry in the way,

  or smAddClick.

   section.
 + StickySections property added. This property controls the size of the
   sections: sticky sections can't get the total width more than the header's
   client width. So the user will never need to scrol the window horizontally
   to see the rest of the sections. This behaviour is implemented in Netscape
   Communicator's lists and trees.
